Part 1:

It should be : 666

After I run test.bash on mac terminal, run "source test.bash"

it output: 666

So my guess is correct. 

The issue is Bash uses Dynamic scoping, so for $x output: 666

I write a .c program to run this, it output: 42

Thus, the Bash use dynamic scoping, but most language uses static scoping, for example java, c, c++.
