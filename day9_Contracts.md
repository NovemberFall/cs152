## Contract Violations

- `contract-out` specifies the requirements.
```scheme
#lang racket
 
(provide (contract-out [amount positive?]))
 
(define amount 'amount)
```

- To make the contract capture our intentions for all Racket values, 
we can ensure that the value is both a number and is positive, combining the two contracts with `and/c`
```scheme
#lang racket

(provide (contract-out  [amount (and/c number? positive?)])
)

(define amount 2)
```

## Simple Contracts on Functions
- Recall:
  - A mathematical function has a domain and a range. 
    The domain indicates the kind of values that the function can accept as arguments, 
    and the range indicates the kind of values that it produces
    `f : A -> B`,  where A is the domain of the function and B is the range.

- Functions in a programming language have domains and ranges, too, 
  and a contract can ensure that a function receives only values in its domain 
  and produces only values in its range.
  `A ->` creates such a contract for a function. 
  The forms after `a ->` specify contracts for the domains and finally a contract for the range.

```scheme
(provide (contract-out
          [deposit (-> number? any)]
          [balance (-> number?)]))
 
(define amount 0)
(define (deposit a) (set! amount (+ amount a)))
(define (balance) amount)
```
- The module exports two functions:
  1. `deposit`, which accepts a number and returns some value that is not specified in the contract, and
  2. `balance`, which returns a number indicating the current balance of the account.

- `A ->` by itself is not a contract; 
  it is a contract combinator, which combines other contracts to form a contract.

## Styles of ->
- If you are used to mathematical functions, 
  you may prefer a contract arrow to appear between the domain and the range of a function, 
  not at the beginning. If you have read How to Design Programs, you have seen this many times. 
  Indeed, you may have seen contracts such as these in other peopleâ€™s code:
```scheme
(provide (contract-out
          [deposit (number? . -> . any)]))
```
